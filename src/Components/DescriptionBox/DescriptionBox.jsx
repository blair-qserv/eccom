                Ecommerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to
                the buying and selling of goods and services over the
                internet. It involves online transactions between businesses
                and consumers or between businesses themselves, typically
                through websites or mobile apps. Ecommerce platforms provide
                 a digital marketplace where users can browse products, 
                 place orders, and make payments, often with added features
                  like customer reviews, inventory management, and secure
                   checkout options.
